## About me
Hello, my name is Stephanie Csikasz. I am a student at brock university in Interactive arts and science. I decided to come to brock to pursue my interest in digital animation and games and have further branched my interest into writing and storytelling. In my free time I have been learning guitar and trying new recipes. Whether its physical or digital, musical or edible, written or verbal, I love all forms of creative expression and hope to further my skills in every way possible.
