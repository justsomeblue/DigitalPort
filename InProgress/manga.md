## My Best Friend Is The Main Character

A collaboration with my friend [aihara_art]( https://www.instagram.com/aihara_art/?hl=en) inspired by the group work in IASC 1F01. This class has helped me gain confidence in my leadership and team skills, and so I agreed to this collaboration and plan to see it through to the very end.

### What is it?

This is a manga idea I had a long time ago but lacked the confidence or skill level to pull off. Now, together with Aihara I will be working as the author and he will be working as the illustrator.
